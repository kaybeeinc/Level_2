##Topics:

###Points Forecast -
Our user stories had originally range from 3-34 Points. We forecase that we cna do upwards of 7 story points 
per sprint. Hence, we will break down future user stories into additional stories as we work on them in the 
Sprint backlog.

###Rationale for Forecast:
Our rationale for how many points we can complete in a 2 week sprint, comes from our discussion of the complexity 
of the work, and what we feel it would take to coordinate. 

###Stories into Sprint Backlog
We've since broken down a user story to 2 stories of 3 points each (total of 6 points, less than the 7 forecast), and brought it into our Backlog. 
As well, all stories in the backlog are less than 50% of the forecast velocity we have set.

###Stories into Tasks
We've begun turning those stories into Tasks using a Trello list, and assigning responsibility for each.

In order to develop and work, using BDD and TDD, we've designed simple behaviors and tests, to drive incremental development and completion of the tasks.

### FAR VISION:
The tool or Wordpess plugin gives real-time update on the sales ranks of a list of books/market against your selected books, and traffic for prospective content. Use of the app is for competitive analysis so authors may determine which books sell well, and how their own book is doing comparatively. The app will also allow authors to see what potential readers are searching for to develop and market content accordingly. The app may also compare other author's website traffic or online "buzz", for example using comparative search hits from Alexa, comments and ratings from Amazon, and mentions across the web. We aim to pull data and resuls from Amazon, Barnes and Noble, GoodReads, Google, Alexa, Bing, Yahoo, and others. 

### NEAR VISION 
Prototype of the dashboard, live on a wordpress site, and conforms to a WP plug in guidelines 
-	Author facing dashboard
-	Pull data at least from Amazon.com for data
-	Customer facing options (shows to reader) – status and metrics against selected books, as permissioned by author

### Future Vision
We will continue to build on the work of the Wordpress website, and build into the API's of future connections and features important for our stakeholders.
